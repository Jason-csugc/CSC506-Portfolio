This project was developed and tested on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS using WSL on Windows 11

#### Repository Restore and Setup

1. Install python3 version 3.11 or later
2. Install python3 venv virtual environment package
3. Clone the repository (https://github.com/Jason-csugc/CSC506-Portfolio.git)
4. Create a virtual environment called 'portfolio' in the root directory of the reporitory(python3 -m vevn portfolio)
5. Activate the virtual environment (source portfolio/bin/activate)
6. Restore the requirements via pip (pip install -r requirements.txt)

2. After the Tkinter window opens click the "Run Analysis" button to execute the algorithm tests


### Results
1. The top panel in the application window shows the "Sorting Time Complexity" and "Sorting Space Complexity" graphs
2. The bottom panel in the application window shows the tabular data generated by the analyzer function
3. You may need to resize the window to see all of the result information
